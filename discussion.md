## What is Predictive Analytics?
We are all part of a graduate program in “Predictive Analytics”, and we are
taking a course titled “Predictive Modeling I”. What is “predictive analytics”,
and what is “predictive modeling”? How do they differ?

__Response__:

I was thrown a bit by this inquiry, however I feel like the best way to
differentiate between 'predictive modeling' and 'predictive analytics' is to say
that when 'predictive modeling' is deployed commercially it is commonly called
'predictive analytics' [^1][^2]. It appears that within the 'predictive
analytics' nomenclature there can be more 'types' than 'predictive modeling', to
include descriptive models and decision models [^0].

## Statistical Graphics and Exploratory Data Analysis
Statistical graphics are commonly used throughout the modeling process. How are
statistical graphics used in exploratory data analysis?

The term “data visualization” is frequently used in conjunction with the term
“analytics”. Is there a difference between the term “data visualization” and the
term “statistical graphics”?

__Response__:

Data visualization generally aims to provide a mechanism for visual
communication [^0]. In essence; tell a story from some underlying data. This can
mean that the creator uses creative license to illustrate the message intended
for the audience [^2]. Statistical graphics are use to visualize quantitative
data, they are direct representations of the data, and directly computed values
from the data with the only creative license being in the modeling techniques.

## Regression at Work
A primary topic of this course is “regression analysis”, also called linear
regression, Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, or the Gaussian linear
model. Do you use regression at work? If so, how do you use regression at work?

__Response__:

We more commonly will elicit distribution parameters to provide us with a
variable to randomly sample during a simulation [^0]. I've personally
implemented several optimization strategies and think that a rigorous exposure
to regression methods will help me to more clearly understand some of the
comparative operations within the fitness comparison of various strategies.
