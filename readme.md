Artifacts from completing Northwestern University Predict 410
=============================================================

    This course develops the foundations of predictive modeling by: introducing the
    conceptual foundations of regression and multivariate analysis; developing
    statistical modeling as a process that includes exploratory data analysis, model
    identification, and model validation; and discussing the difference between the
    uses of statistical models for statistical inference versus predictive modeling.
    The high level topics covered in the course include: exploratory data analysis,
    statistical graphics, linear regression, automated variable selection, principal
    components analysis, exploratory factor analysis, and cluster analysis.

I'm sharing artifacts from my completion of the course with the intent that
someone may benefit from the approach taken. I'm sharing everything that I think
is reasonable without treading on the publishers of reference texts, and the
university. I'd ask that if you've come upon this repository and use it for
reference, please contact me and let me know what helped you. Alternatively, if
you've found this and believe I'm in violation for sharing the material, please
contact me first rather than issue a take-down.

Northwestern's [Predictive Analytics](http://sps.northwestern.edu/program-
areas/graduate/predictive-analytics/) program was the first that I found to
provide full degree accreditation from a completely on-line program with
curriculum vectoring towards becoming a practitioner of Data Science. I'm
excited to participate in the program and hope that the university doesn't take
offense in me sharing this coursework.

I would like to see higher education adopt a more open form of education, much
like what we're seeing in the massively on-line open courses of late. I further
would like to see institutions choose to use libre/open technology in their
curriculum, as these tools are forms of expression that become unavailable to
students after separation with the institution. Where possible I've tried to use
or reproduce work in libre/open form, however time is always limited.
