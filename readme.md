Artifacts from completing Northwestern University Predict 410
=============================================================

    This course develops the foundations of predictive modeling by: introducing the
    conceptual foundations of regression and multivariate analysis; developing
    statistical modeling as a process that includes exploratory data analysis, model
    identification, and model validation; and discussing the difference between the
    uses of statistical models for statistical inference versus predictive modeling.
    The high level topics covered in the course include: exploratory data analysis,
    statistical graphics, linear regression, automated variable selection, principal
    components analysis, exploratory factor analysis, and cluster analysis.

I'm sharing with the intent that someone else may benefit from finding the work
from this course. Be it from the formatting or coding this course requires. I
want to make it a practice to openly share the work that goes into achieving
this degree program, despite the potentially embarrassing reality that someone
may read work that was completed under duress at the last minute.

Northwestern's distance program was one of the first to make available a set of
curriculum that was vectored toward gaining the knowledge for becoming a
practitioner of data science. I'm excited to participate in this program and
hope the university doesn't frown on me openly sharing limited excerpts from
their prepared material and fully the work I prepared for the course.

I would like very much to see higher education adopt a more open form of
education, much like what we're seeing from the massively open on-line courses
recently.

Please feel free to contact me about the work within this repository, course,
and personal experience with Northwestern's Predicive Analytics degree program.
